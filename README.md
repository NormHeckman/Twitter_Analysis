# Twitter-Analysis

These notebooks create word clouds for twitter collections.

In order to run these juypiter notebooks locally, download the files to your workstation. Place the uncompressed files in a known location. A full installation of Anaconda on that workstation is recommended.

If you have Anaconda, then open an Anaconda bash shell.
For example in the case that the jupyter_notebooks directory is installed at: c:/workspace/Twitter-Analysis/jupyter_notebooks then type the followint command to open the notebooks:
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=c:/workspace/Twitter-Analysis/jupyter_notebooks

Note that the twitter data files read would be located in a parallel input directory. For the example case above, the input directory would be located at C:/workspace/jupyter/input

Notes:
kaggle_tweets.csv is the original file from the Kaggle example. 
tweetsP.csv is from a Mozdeh collection of tweets sent by Putin, @PutinRF_Eng
Tweets.csv is from a cree.py collection of tweets sent by Lewanowski, @CLewandowski_ and Trump, @realDonaldTrump
