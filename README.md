# Twitter-Analysis

In order to run these juypiter notebooks locally, download the files to your workstation. Place the uncompressed files in a known location. A full installation of Anaconda on that workstation is reccomended.

Open an Anaconda bash shell and then type:
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=\<full path to the  location of the newly downloaded jupyter_notebooks directory>\/jupyter_notebooks

For example, im the case that the jupyter_notebooks directory is installed at: c:/workspace/Twitter-Analysis/jupyter_notebooks then the commad would be
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=c:/workspace/Twitter-Analysis/jupyter_notebooks

Note that the raw twitter data files read would be located in a parralel direcgory 
Input directory is C:/workspace/jupyter/input
